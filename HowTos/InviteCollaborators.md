# Invite new members to our website


If a new member has joined, youâ€™ll want to (i) make sure they create a GitHub
account and (ii) add them as a contributor. To do the latter, go to `Settings ->
Collaborators and teams -> Add people`, look up their GitHub handle, and add
them.

Everyone expect the admins have `write` as their role.
