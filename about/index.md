<h5>Research Statement</h5>

Based on the <a href="https://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017.pdf">
The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity</a>.

<p align="justify">
Good research practices are based on fundamental principles of research
integrity. They guide researchers in their work as well as in their engagement
with the practical, ethical and intellectual challenges inherent in research.
These principles are:
</p>

<li>Reliability in ensuring the quality of research, reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis and the use of resources.</li>
<li>Honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a transparent, fair, full and unbiased way.</li>
<li>Respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the environment.</li>
<li>Accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts.</li>

As a research group we strive to follow them.

<h5>Diversity Statement</h5>

<p align="justify">
We encourage everyone to apply to be a member of our group and we are committed to building a research group for all.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, national origin,
political beliefs, race, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. We will
not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above,
including participants with disabilities.
