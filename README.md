# Personal Website for the Group Dynamics of Social Behavior

Welcome to the source code for our website:
http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/.

## A new member joined the group?

In our group, every member becomes a collaborator in this repository. This allows
everyone to push code and contribute easily. There are other ways to handle
this, but we prefer to keep things simple.

To add a new member as a collaborator, see: [Invite new members to our website](HowTos/InviteCollaborators.md)
