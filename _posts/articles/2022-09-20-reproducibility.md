The Research Group Dynamics of Social Behavior (DYNOSOB ðŸ¦–) was created only a
few years ago. In the earlier years of the group it was important to us that we
set some "rules" and create a somewhat of a common workflow. The rules are
regarding the way we do research and publish scientific results, and the main reason we wanted to
set these rules was reproducibility.

Reproducibility is the trademark of good science, and on that note the use of
tools, such as version control and hosting platforms for version control, are
becoming vastly used.

In this blog post we would like to outline the "rules" and workflow we
established for our research group. We decided to use the version control system
[git](https://git-scm.com/) and the hosting platform
[GitHub](https://github.com/). git was the obvious choice since one of our
group members is very familiar with the tool, and we decided to
use GitHub over GitLab because it was easier for us to collaborate with external
collaborators via GitHub.

**Introduction to the tools.** Any new member that joins our group has to
complete a workshop on ["Introduction to Research Software
Development"](https://mpievolbio-scicomp.pages.gwdg.de/rsd-workshop/intro.html).
This workshop is intended for complete beginners and it covers:

* Introduction to the command line
* Introduction to Python
* Best practices for writing software (with Python examples) 
* Version control with git
* Using GitLab and GitHub

A new member can either cover the material on their own time, or attend one
of the annual workshops offered by Nikoleta (group member) and Carsten
Fortmann-Grote (head of the scientific computing unit at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology).

After a new member has completed the workshop they are asked to create a
personal profile and add it to the group's
[website](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/). The source code for the
website is hosted on GitHub
([repository](https://github.com/DYNOSOBs/social-behaviour)) and in order to add
a profile one needs to use git to clone the project, commit their changes and
open a pull request. We use this as an exercise to give new members a more
"realistic" experience with the git and GitHub.

**Housekeeping.** As you might have noticed the website's repository is part of
the organisation [DYNOSOBs](https://github.com/DYNOSOBs) which is the
organisation used to host any group related repositories.

The organisation includes the following repositories (as of today):

- DYNOSOB-talks: contains presentation slides and posters of the group.
- DYNOSOB-bibliography: contains a shared bibliography.
- DYNOSOB-tutorials: a collection of examples and tutorials of techniques that
  we have put together.


The organisation is also used to host a copy of project related repositories.
This brings us to the next part.

**Conducting science & publishing results.** The members of our group are
expected to use git to manage their research projects, and moreover each
research project is expected to have a corresponding GitHub repository.

The learning curve for git can be quite steep in the beginning. For this reason
we have put together a flow chart with commands that we find useful
(please let us know if we can improve or if we forgot something):

A research project's GitHub repository is expected to contain all the code
that was used to produce the scientific results, and the files necessary
to compile the manuscript (we write our papers in LaTex). The repositories
are usually kept private while we work on projects and once a paper has been
published we make them public. Following a publication the members are asked
to create a copy of that repo under the organisation [DYNOSOBs](https://github.com/DYNOSOBs).
That way even if the member leaves or deletes their GitHub profile
the source material can still be found.

Note that we do not use GitHub to host the data produced by our simulations, or
from our experiments. For data we use websites such as
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io).
