Hi! This is Saptarshi. I am interested in mathematical models that study the role of reputation and information on the evolution of cooperation and coordination. I am currently a PhD student.

I received my masters degree from the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, Canada in 2020. 

I grew up in Kolkata, India. Outside work, I love playing chess, bouldering, listening and playing music.
