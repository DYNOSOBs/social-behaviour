Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the MIT Media Lab Human Dynamics Group
and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics.

Moshe obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago,
Booth School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago.

Moshe applies game theory, models of learning and evolution, and experimental
methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious) motives that shape our
social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.

Together with [Erez Yoeli](http://www.erezyoeli.com), he co-designed and
teaches ["Game Theory and Social Behavior"](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/61567)
which lays out this approach.

For concise introductions to this approach, please see his
[research statement](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dl/jplsl4anz098ixr/mh%20research%20statement.pdf),
or the (draft) [introduction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dl/jplsl4anz098ixr/mh%20research%20statement.pdf)
for the popular-science book he is working on.
