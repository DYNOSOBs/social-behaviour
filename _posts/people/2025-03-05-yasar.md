I am Adile Yasar. Beginning with September 2024, I am a PhD student in the Research Group Dynamics of Social Behavior.

I am originally from Berlin but studied Psychology in Braunschweig and GÃ¶ttingen. Previously, I have worked on topics such as human consciousness, intuitive physics, social learning, and cultural evolution. I am trained in a wide range of experimental research methods, including computational techniques like mouse tracking, N=1 analyses, and comparative studies with chimpanzees. 

I am interested in following research questions: 

<ul>
    <li><strong>Which contexts enable human cooperation?</strong> I study this by manipulating experimental contexts using pre-defined bots in a public goods game.</li>
    <li><strong>How does AI influence human innovation?</strong> In a world increasingly influenced by Artificial Intelligence, I am particularly interested in understanding how AI-generated solutions may influence human innovation.</li>
</ul>

Please get in touch, in case you are interested to discuss research with me!
